# cs598_reproducing_clinical_notes_diagnosis_dl_nlp

In this project I am reproducing the model built in the paper "An empirical evaluation of deep learning for ICD-9 code assignment using MIMIC-III clinical notes" 

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169260718309945?via%3Dihub

I am using most of the code used in the original paper but I am altering as needed.

Original Code can be found here:
