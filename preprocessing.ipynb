of hospital course copd dyspnea pneumonia the patient was initially placed on an aggressive steroid taper and admitted to the medical intensive care unit due to her difficulty with oxygenation despite cpap machine she was also given nebulizer treatments q h as well as chest pt the nebulizers were increased to q h due to the fact that she continued to have labored breathing due to persistent respiratory failure and labored breathing the patient was intubated on in order to improve oxygenation ventilation and ability to suction a bronchoscopy was performed on which demonstrated marked narrowing of the airways with expiration consistent with tracheomalacia on two silicone stents were placed one in the left main stem x and one in the trachea x by dr under rigid bronchoscopy with general anesthesia on the patient was extubated to a cool mist shovel mask and her oxygen was titrated down to liters nasal cannula at which time she was transferred to the medical floor on the medical floor the steroids were weaned to off on and the patient was saturating at on liters on room air on the patient was seen again by the interventional pulmonology service who agreed that she looked much improved and recommended that she go to pulmonary rehabilitation with followup within six weeks time status post placement of stents in respiratory failure cardiovascular the patient was ruled out for a mi she did have another episode on the medical floor of chest pain which showed no evidence of ekg changes and negative troponin negative cks x3 she was continued on aspirin imdur and diltiazem for rate control per her outpatient regimen hypertension she was maintained on diltiazem and hydrochlorothiazide with adequate blood pressure control and normalization of electrolytes hematuria the patient had intermittent hematuria likely secondary to foley placement the foley catheter was discontinued on she had serial urinalyses which were all negative for signs of infection hyperglycemia patient was placed on insulin sliding scale due to hyperglycemia which was steroid induced this worked quite well and her glucose came back to normal levels once the steroids were tapered to off leukocytosis patient did have a profound leukocytosis of to during much of her hospital course as the steroids were tapered to off her white blood cell count on was it was felt that the

continued on outpatient medical regimen depression the patient was continued on lexapro per outpatient regimen it is recommended that she follow up with a therapist as an outpatient due to the fact that she did have a blunted affect throughout much of the hospital course and did appear clinically to be depressed prophylaxis she was maintained on proton pump inhibitor with subq heparin sore

and neck\n\n\nHistory of Present Illness:\nMrs. [**Known lastname 60498**] is an 83 year old right handed woman with a\nhistory of htn and nephrectomy.  Yesterday evening she had the\nacute onset of left arm weakness that she noted when she was\nunable to pull her pants up after having a bowel movement.  She\nwas brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED where she was noted to have a left\nfacial droop, distal > proximal arm weakness and decreased\nsensation on the left side.  There was no hemorrhage on CT.  An\nMRI/MRA did not show any vascular cutoff but there was an area\nof\nrestricted diffusion and tPA was administered just under the 3\nhour mark.  Since then she has had little change in her weakness\nor numbness.  She has had brief 30 second episodes of left\nfacial\ntwitching which resolved after being loaded on dilantin.\n\n\nPast Medical History:\n-h/o nephrectomy\n-h/o breast lumpectomy\n-hypertension\n\n\nSocial History:\n-lives by self and is independent in all ADLs\n-no recent alcohol or tobacco use\n\n\nFamily History:\n-no history of seizures or strokes\n\n\nPhysical Exam:\nGeneral:  elderly woman in no acute distress\nNeck: supple\nLungs: clear to auscultation\nCV: regular rate and rhythm\nAbdomen:  non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present\nExt: warm, no edema\n\nNeurologic Examination:\nMental Status:\nAwake and alert, cooperative with exam, normal affect\nOriented to person, place, month and president\nAttention: Can say months of year backward and forward\nLanguage: Fluent, mild dysarthria, no paraphasic errors, naming\nintact\nFund of knowledge normal\nNo apraxia, No neglect\n[**Location (un) **] intact\n\nCranial Nerves:\nVisual fields are full to confrontation.

The left atrium is mildly dilated.\n2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal\ntechnical\nquality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully\nexcluded. Overall\nleft ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).\n3. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial\nmitral\nregurgitation.\n4. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.\n\nMRI/MRA brain:\n1) Subacute or chronic infarct involving the right frontal lobe\nposteriorly. Followup imaging can be helpful in further\nevaluation of this area and assessment of progression of\npossible stroke.\n2) Moderate chronic small vessel infarct involving bilateral\ncerebral hemispheres.\n3) Diffuse atrophy.\n4) normal MRA brain\n\nCarotid duplex ultrasound:\nFINDINGS: Duplex evaluation was performed of both carotid and\nvertebral arteries.\nOn the right, peak systolic velocities are 71, 69, 52 in the\nICA, CCA, and ECA respectively. The ICA to CCA ratio is 1. This\nis a consistent with no stenosis.\nOn the left, peak systolic velocities are 85, 76, 69 in the ICA,\nCCA, and ECA respectively. The ICA to CCA ratio is 1.1.

Patient sustained some improvement in left arm\nstrength s/p tPA.  She had a follow up head CT which showed no\nevidence of hemorrhage s/p tPA.  While in the ICU, the patient\ndeveloped focal motor seizures (left facial twitching) and was\nloaded with dilantin. An EEG was ordered while the patient was\nin the ICU.  The EEG showed sharp waves and slowing in the right\nfrontotemporal/frontocentral areas and left temporal lobes\nsuggesting deep midline subcortical dysfunction consistent with\nencephalopathy.  The EEG is also consistent with abnormalities\nseconardary to a large stroke.  The patient's dilantin level was\nroutinely checked and was therapeutic on discharge.  She will be\ncontinued on daily dilantin.\n\nStroke etiology was evaluated with several tests. Carotid\nultrasound was performed which showed no significant hemodynamic\nlesions in either the right or left carotids.  Echocardiogram\nwas performed which showed an EF of 55% and no evidence of clot\nor thrombus.  The patient's LDL was 95 and she was started on\nlipitor 20 mg daily.  She also ruled out for a myocardial\ninfarction by three sets of cardiac markers.  The patient was\nalso started on an aspirin (325mg); on the day of discharge\naggrenox was added and her aspirin dose was decreased to 81 mg.\nThe patient is to continue with both medications for the next\ntwo weeks and then is to discontinue aspirin and continue on\naggrenox alone.  It is also recommended that the patient be\nstarted on an ACE-inhibitor.  Her beta blocker (metoprolol) was\nheld in the peristroke period.\n\nOver the course of her hospitalization, the patient's proximal\nleft arm strength appeared to improve, however she did not\nregain any movement in her left wrist, hand or fingers.  Her\nleft leg strength also improved.\n\nThe patient passed the swallow evaluation and she was started on\na full regular diet.  She was evaluated by physical therapy and\noccupational therapy and inpatient rehabilitation was deemed\nappropriate.  She is to be discharged to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with\nfollow up in the neurology stroke clinic.\n\nMedications on Admission:\n-metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 **]\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

RHYTHM:  83-yo man with hypertension, atrial fibrillation,\nnon-ischemic cardiomyopathy, and ? h/o tachy-brady versus\ncomplete heart block, s/p dual chamber pacemaker placement in\n[**2143**] with upgrade to dual chamber BiV in [**2149**]. In recent weeks\nhe has been having frequent episodes of dizziness and feeling\nfaint, as well as three syncopal episodes in the last week, most\nrecently one day prior to admission when he fell and hit his\nhead and was unarousable for approx 2 minutes. At [**Hospital3 **]\nHospital, he underwent a NCHCT that revealed a small SAH.\nC-spine and L-spine CTs did not show any evidence of fracture.\nCardiology was consulted and his device was interrogated, and he\nwas found to be having episodes of asystole that were felt to\ncoincide with these events. It is hypothesized that his Fidelis\nRV lead is fractured which is inhibiting V-pacing and resulting\nin these episodes of asystole, and attempts to program RV\nsensing off were unsuccessful, so he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]\nfor extraction of the Fidelis lead and implantation of a new\nlead. He is anticoagulated with an INR of 2.6, so received 5mg\nPO Vitamin K and 2units FFP prior to transfer.\n.\nOn transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], he was continued on his home BB and\namiodarone, but he continued to have symptomatic pauses as long\nas 6-7 seconds overnight, with an episode of syncope that\ncorrelated with a pause on telemetry. He was seen by EP, who\nattempted to adjust his pacemaker settings, but he was\nultimately taken to the EP lab for placement of a temporary\npacing wire [**6-15**]. He was transferred to the CCU for continued\nmonitoring and remained stable. Pt remained stable over the\nweekend and did not become bradycardic or hypotensive. Pt went\nfor pacemaker revision on [**6-18**]. Pt did well and was transfered\nback to the floor. Pt did not develop any complications from the\nprocedure.\n\n.\n#. SDH/SAH: Post-traumatic in setting of syncope/fall while\ntherapeutic on coumadin with INR 2.8. At [**Hospital3 **] Hospital, he\nunderwent a NCHCT that revealed a small SAH. C-spine and L-spine\nCTs did not show any evidence of fracture.  At [**Hospital1 18**] he was also\nseen by Neurosurgery and underwent urgent NCHCT, which revealed\nbilateral subacute-chronic hemispheric SDH, acute post-traumatic\nSAH, a small subgaleal hematoma, and cavernous malformation\nversus parenchymal hemorrhagic contusion. This was not felt to\nbe significantly different from the serial NCHCTs he received at\nOSH prior to transfer. He was placed in a soft collar for\ncomfort and received an additional 2mg PO Vitamin K and 2units\nFFP for INR 1.8, with unremarkable neuro checks overnight.  He\nreceived a total of Vitamin K 7mg PO and 4units FFP w/ INR 1.4.\nNeurologically intact without concerning neuro checks and\nSDH/SAH stable per NSG. His C-spine was clinically cleared on\n[**6-16**].  Pt had repeat CT heads without signficant interval\nchange. Pt is to have a repeat CT head on [**6-21**] and follow up\nwith Neurosurgery with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 1 mo. Pt also received 3d\nof Vancomycin prior to procedure. Vancomycin was d/c'd on\n[**2153-6-19**] and switched to 7 day course of Levofloxacin.\n\n# PUMP: ECHO: EF 30-35% Moderate global left ventricular\nsystolic dysfunction. Severe tricupsid regurgitation, mostly\naround the multiple pacemaker/defibrillator leads. Pt was\nhypervolemic and pt was diuresed while in the CCU with torsemide\n60 daily, spironolactone 25 daily, and was negative 1L prior to\nprocedure, but still had bilateral rales and received another\nlasix 40mg IV x1 prior to procedure. Pt stable for discharge on\n[**6-19**] per EP and CCU but desaturated to 88% on NC when wean\nattempted. CXR suggested fluid overload so pt diuresed and was\nable to wean on [**6-20**].

Infant delivered by SVD\nwith Apgars of 8 and 9.\n\nMother's prenatal screens are blood type O+, antibody\nnegative, RPR nonreactive, HBSAG was not available at the\ntime of admission (however, later it was determined that the\nmother was HBsAg negative). The infant had done well in the\nnormal nursery, was ad lib. breast feeding with no\nsupplementation.\n\nThe bilirubin was done at 36 hours of age which showed a\nbilirubin level of 20.8. A CBC and reticulocyte were sent.\nThe hematocrit was 43. The infant was ordered to start under\nphototherapy. 4 hours later a repeat bilirubin level was\nsent, and the bilirubin had gone up to 23.3/0.5. At that time\nthe infant was admitted to the NICU.  The baby's blood type\nis B+, but the DAT was also positive.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The birth weight is 3675,\n90th percentile; length is 52 cm, which is 90th percentile;\nhead circumference is 34 cm, which is 50th-75th percentile.\nOn exam the infant is jaundiced but active in term. Has HEENT\nthat is normal. Normal heart rate and rhythm. Normal S1, S2.\nNo murmurs. Lungs are clear and equal. Abdomen is benign. No\nhepatosplenomegaly. Normal male genitalia. Neurologic exam is\nnormal for term infant. Normal cry. Normal tone.\n\nSUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:\nRespiratory: The infant remained in room air since admission\nto the NICU and has had no issues with apnea. Has maintained\nnormal breathing rate and rhythm, with no increased work of\nbreathing.\n\nCardiovascular: The infant has maintained a normal\ncardiovascular status- has not presented with any murmurs,\nhas normal heart rate and rhythm, normal blood pressure, and\nis well perfused.\n\nFluids, electrolytes, nutrition: Due to the significant\nbilirubin increase on admission, the patient was briefly made\nNPO and started on IV fluids of D10 with electrolytes. He was\nalso given a single normal saline bolus due to question of\nsome dehydration from sole breast feeding. The infant was\nstarted on feedings approximately 6 hours after admission to\nthe NICU when the bilirubin level did start to drop. No\nelectrolytes have been measured. The most recent weight is\n3625 grams on [**2171-8-11**].\n\nGI: After initiating of phototherapy with quadruple\nphototherapy on admission to the NICU, the bilirubin level\nquickly started to drop down. Within 3 hours of initiation of\nphototherapy on admission to the NICU, bilirubin dropped to\n20. The next subsequent day it had continued to decrease.\nPhototherapy was slowly withdrawn with a bilirubin level of\n10.9/0.3 on [**2171-8-11**]. The phototherapy was completely\ndiscontinued, and a rebound bilirubin level was drawn 8 hours\nafter that. That bilirubin level was unchanged at 10.9/0.3.\nThe infant was discharged to home and returned to the NICU on\n[**8-12**] for a follow-up bilirubin.  The level was 11.3/0.4.\n\nHematology: As stated previously, the infant's blood type is\nB+. Coombs' positive. The hematocrit has stayed stable.\nThe hematocrit on admission was 43, and it was 42.3 on [**2171-8-10**]. The patient has remained pink and well perfused. A\nreticulocyte count was done on [**2171-8-10**], which was 10.8.\nInfant has required no blood product transfusion.\n\nInfectious disease: There have been no infectious disease\nissues at this time.\n\nNeurology: The infant has maintained a normal neurologic exam\nfor a term male infant.\n\nSensory/Audiology: A hearing screen was performed with\nautomated auditory brainstem responses, and infant passed in\nboth ears on [**2171-8-11**].\n\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Good.\n\nDISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  Home with the family.\n\nNAME OF PRIMARY PEDIATRICIAN:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 38832**], MD [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 8513**]\n[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], NNP [**Location 67622**]Pediatrics.

Axial\nimaging was performed with gradient echo technique in the\ncervical spine and\nlong TR, long TE fast spin echo technique in the thoracic and\nlumbar spines.\nComparison to T-spine CT studies of [**2191-6-12**].\n\nFINDINGS: There appears to be a fracture of the superior portion\nof the T1\nvertebral body, also involving the inferior C7 body. There is\nwedging of the\nT1 and discontinuity of the anterior margins of the vertebral\nbodies at this\nlocation. There is hyperintensity in the C6 vertebral body on\nthe STIR images\nwithout definite evidence of fracture. There is hyperintensity\nin the C6-C7\nand C7-T1 intervertebral discs, compatible with acute trauma.\nThere is faint\nhyperintensity on STIR images in the posterior ligamentous\ncomplex at C6,\ncompatible with the spinous process fracture seen on the CT.\nThere is\nextensive prevertebral fluid, presumably hemorrhage. There\nappears to be\nintraspinal hemorrhage posterior to the spinal cord at the level\nof the\nligamentous injury, with unclear extent within the spinal canal.\nAt a\nminimum, this appears to be present at the C5 through C7 levels,\nbut may\nextend farther inferiorly into the thoracic spinal canal.\n\nThe patient has classic imaging findings of ankylosing\nspondylitis and has\nundergone posterior fusion with rods and pedicle screws from\nT7-T12.\n\nImages of the lumbar spine demonstrate changes of ankylosing\nspondylitis with no evidence of fracture or abnormalities\nencroaching on the spinal canal.\n\nThere appears to be a defect in the T11 vertebral body. There is\nno evidence of encroachment on the spinal canal or spinal cord\nat this level and no evidence of hemorrhage.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n1. Unstable-appearing cervical spine fracture with disruption of\nthe C6-C7\nintervertebral level, the C7 inferior vertebral body, and the\nsuperior T1\nbody. Extensive prevertebral soft tissue fluid. Hyperintensity\nin the\nposterior ligamentous complex suggesting fracture. Intraspinal\nfluid\ncollection, presumably epidural hematoma, posterior to the\nspinal cord at this\nlevel.\n2. Hyperintensity and apparent fracture of the superior portion\nof the T11\nbody, without evidence of hemorrhage.\n3. Ankylosing spondylitis, status post lower thoracic spine\nfusion.\n\nECG\nBaseline artifact. Probable sinus rhythm. P-R interval\nprolongation.\nIntraventricular conduction delay of right bundle-branch block\ntype with marked left axis deviation. Consider left anterior\nfascicular block. Since the previous tracing of [**2191-6-12**]\ndifferences may be due to artifact.

**], whose last\nname will be [**Name (NI) **] at discharge, was born at 33 and 2/7\nweeks gestation by Cesarean section for non reassuring fetal\nheart rate. Mother is a 33 year-old, Gravida IV, Para 1 now 2\nwoman.  Mother's prenatal screen included blood type A\npositive, antibody screen negative, Rubella immune, RPR non\nreactive, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, and group B\nstrep unknown. The previous pregnancies were remarkable for\nintrauterine fetal demise at 17 weeks in [**2158**] and a 28 week\ndelivery in [**2160**].  That child is alive and well. She also had\na spontaneous loss in [**2167**].  This pregnancy was complicated\nby:  (1) cervical incompetence, treated with cerclage at 14\nweeks and managed with progesterone in light of the previous\npregnancy history. (2) Increased nuchal lucency and a 2\nvessel umbilical cord. (3) Amniocentesis with a normal\nkaryotype of 46XX.  (4) Normal fetal echo x2 at [**Hospital3 18242**].  (5) Intrauterine growth restriction. The mother\nreceived a complete course of betamethasone at 30.5 weeks\ngestation.\n\nRupture of membranes occurred at time of delivery with yellow\nstained amniotic fluid. The infant received free flow oxygen\nand mask C-Pap in the delivery room. The Apgar scores were 6\nat 1 minute and 8 at 5 minutes.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, weight was 1235 grams,\nless than the 10th percentile.  Length 38 cm, less than the\n10th percentile.  Head circumference 25 cm, less than the\n10th percentile. This small for gestational age dysmorphic\ninfant with anterior fontanel and posterior fontanel both\nopen, soft and flat, no cutis aplasia, low nuchal hair line,\nthickened nuchal fold, hypertelorism with wide nasal bridge\nand beaking of the nose, cleft palate both hard and soft,\nintact lip. Ears slightly low set and posteriorly rotated\nwith somewhat central pinna.  Red reflexes present, positive\nbrush-field spots. Wide space nipples. Short sternum.  Fair\naeration. Crackly breath sounds. No murmur. Normal pulses.\nSoft abdomen, 2 vessel cord. No hepatosplenomegaly.  No\nmasses.  Preterm female genitalia with large clitoris, small\nvaginal opening and a vaginal tag. Patent anus.  No hip\nclicks. Closed cleft in sacral area with sharp edges of\ncoccyx palpable. Post axial polydactyly bilaterally. No\nsyndactyly. Active with good tone.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  Respiratory:  [**Known lastname 64481**] was intubated soon\nafter admission to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. She\nreceived 2 doses of Surfactant for respiratory distress\nsyndrome. She was extubated to room air on day of life 2. She\nwas intubated and ventilated again on [**2170-9-5**] for her PDA\nligation and then about 12 hours ventilated postoperative and\nthen was extubated to room air. She has otherwise remained in\nroom air throughout her hospitalization. Currently, her\nrespiratory rates range in the 40s to 60s. She does have mild\nincreased work of breathing, associated with feedings or when\nshe is tired.\n\nCardiovascular: [**Known lastname 64481**] has had several echocardiograms\nsince delivery. Her most recent echocardiogram was prior to\nher PDA ligation and this showed a secundum atrial septal\ndefect, patent ductus arteriosus, valvular pulmonary\nstenosis, left pulmonary artery stenosis and pulmonary\nhypertension. In light of her pulmonary hypertension, the\ndecision was made to ligate her patent ductus arteriosus as\nthat was contributing to her pulmonary hypertension. Her\nductus arteriosus was ligated on [**2170-9-5**].  At the time of\ndischarge, [**Known lastname 64481**]'s heart range in the 140s to 160s. She\ncontinues to have a loud murmur, with normal pulses and\nperfusion. A recent blood pressure was 88/56 with a mean of\n64.\n\nFluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  [**Known lastname 64481**] was initially\nmanaged on total parenteral nutrition via a PICC line in the\nleft arm. Enteral feedings were started on day of life 3 and\nadvanced to almost full volume when she had an onset of\nbloody stools and was made n.p.o.  She remained n.p.o. for 14\ndays for presumed necrotizing enterocolitis and feeds were\nrestarted again on day of life 25.  She was advanced to full\nfeedings without problem. She was n.p.o. again briefly for\nher PDA ligation. At the time of discharge, she is on 30\ncalorie per ounce formula as Neo Care concentrated to 27\ncalories per ounce with 3 calories per ounce of corn oil or\nbreast milk with Neo sure powder to equal 27 calories per\nounce with 3 calories per ounce of corn oil added, to equal a\ntotal of 30 calories per ounce. She is feeding on ad lib\ndemand with a premature Habermann feeder and is taking\nanywhere between 150 to 180 ml/kg per day with slow weight\ngain. Discharge weight is 1840 grams. Length 43 cm. Head\ncircumference 27.5 cm.\n\nGastrointestinal:  [**Known lastname 64481**] was treated with phototherapy for\nhyperbilirubinemia of prematurity. Her peak bilirubin on day\nof life 3 with a total of 6.7, direct of 0.3.  On day of life\n8, she presented with frankly bloody stools. Her abdominal x-\nray showed mildly dilated bowel loops and a nonspecific gas\npattern. There was no pneumatosis. She was treated with 14\ndays of bowel rest and antibiotics.  Since refeeding, she has\ndone well without bloody stools.\n\nHematology:  She has not received any blood products during\nher NICU stay. Her last hematocrit on [**2170-8-18**] was 30 with a\nreticulocyte count of 4.3%. She received supplemental iron.\n\nInfectious disease:  [**Known lastname 64481**] received 48 hours of Ampicillin\nand Gentamycin changed to Cefotaxime. On admission for rule\nout sepsis, and sepsis was ruled out. Again, on day of life\n9, she received 14 days of Ampicillin and Cefotaxime for a\npresumed necrotizing enterocolitis. When she is not on\nAmpicillin, she has been receiving Amoxicillin 20 mg/kg per\nday for renal prophylaxis due to hydronephrosis.\n\nOn day of life 37, she received a 5 day course of\nErythromycin ophthalmic ointment for bilateral\nconjunctivitis.\n\nUrine was sent x3 for CMV and all were negative.\n\nRenal:  A renal ultrasound on [**2170-7-24**] showed small peripheral\ncysts within both kidneys suggestive of dysplasia. No\nhydronephrosis and a normal bladder. A follow-up renal\nultrasound on [**8-6**] showed appropriate interval growth of both\nkidneys. They continued to be echogenic with peripheral\ncysts, suggestive of dysplasia. In addition, a right distal\nhydroureter persistently noted without a ureterocele within\nthe bladder and a normal bladder. A follow-up voiding\ncystourethrogram is recommended after discharge. She will be\nfollowed by the renal service at [**Hospital3 1810**].\n\nGenetics:  She was evaluated by the [**Hospital3 1810**]\ngenetic team. She does have a karyotype of 46XX. In\naddition, her chromosomes are remarkable for 4P deletion,\nconsistent with [**Doctor Last Name 79**]-Hirschorn's syndrome. Additionally, she\nhas trisomy on the 17q chromosome. This is consistent with a\nvery poor prognosis cognitively and developmentally. The\n[**Doctor Last Name **] initially declined any further genetic testing but\nhave decided to pursue this at the [**Hospital3 1810**]\ngenetic department after [**Known lastname 64481**]'s discharge.\n\nOrthopedics:  [**Known lastname 64481**] was evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5385**] of\n[**Hospital3 1810**] plastic surgery and he removed the 6th\nfinger on the ulnar side of both hands on [**2170-8-27**]. The left\nside was connected with a skin bridge and the right side was\nconnected with a skeletal piece. The areas are healing well.\nIn addition, she was noted, on x-ray to have a hemi-vertebra\nat T8.\n\nNeurology: Due to her prominent coccyx and dimple, a spinal\nultrasound was done on [**2170-7-24**] which showed spinal cord conus\ndoes end normally at L1.\n\nHead ultrasound on [**7-24**] showed resolving bilateral germinal\nmatrix hemorrhages. A follow-up head ultrasound on [**7-31**]\nshowed evolving bilateral germinal matrix hemorrhage.\nAdditionally, some mild bilateral ventriculomegaly.  On\n[**2170-8-16**], a repeat head ultrasound again showed evolving\ngerminal matrix hemorrhages and stable mild ventricular\ndilatation.\n\nAudiology:  Hearing screening was performed with automated\nauditory brain stem response. She passed in both ears.\n\nOphthalmology:  The eyes were examined most recently on\n[**2170-8-27**] revealing maturing retinal vessels. A follow-up exam\nis recommended in 9 months.\n\nPsychosocial:  [**Known lastname 64481**]'s last name after discharge will be\n[**Known lastname **] which is the father's last name. This is the first\nbaby for this couple. The mother has another child previously\nborn at 28 weeks who is doing well. The father has 2\ndaughters. The [**Name2 (NI) **] are very involved with [**Known lastname 64481**]'s care\nand have been with her frequently throughout her NICU stay.\n\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable. Infant now 52 days old, 41\nand 6/7 weeks corrected post menstrual age.\n\nDISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  Discharged home with her [**Known lastname **].\n\nNAME OF PRIMARY PEDIATRICIAN:  [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 4320**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 69763**], MD, [**Street Address(1) 69764**]in [**Location (un) 669**].  Telephone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3581**].\n\nCARE AND RECOMMENDATIONS:\n1.  Feeds:  Ad lib feeding with the Habermann feeder, 30\n    calories per ounce feedings with either Neo sure\n    concentrated 27 calories with 3 calories per ounce of\n    corn oil or mother's expressed breast milk with Neo sure\n    powder added to make 27 calories per ounce with 3\n    calories per ounce of corn oil.\n2.  Amoxicillin 36 mg orally daily - for UTI prophylaxis\n3.  Ferrous sulfate (25 mg/ml) 0.2 ml daily.\n4.  Car seat screening was not done as the infant will be\n    discharged home in a car bed.\n5.  Newborn state screen has been done on several occasions.\n    All have been normal.\n6.  Immunizations:  She received her 2 month immunizations on\n    [**2170-9-19**]. She received Pediarix, Hib, pneumococcal 7-\n    valient conjugate vaccine. The Pediarix was the first\n    time she received her hepatitis B.\n7.  Immunizations recommended:  Synagis RSV prophylaxis\n    should be considered from [**Month (only) **] through [**Month (only) 958**] for\n    infants who meet any of the following criteria:\n    (1) Born with hemodynamically signficant congenital heart\ndisease.\n    (2) Born at less than 32 weeks; (3) Born between 32 weeks\n    and 35 weeks with two of the following:  Day care during\n    RSV season, a smoker in the household, neuromuscular\n    disease, airway abnormalities or school age siblings; (4)\n    chronic lung disease.\nBecause of her heart disease and evidence of chronic lund\ndisease, we strongly recommend that she receive Synagis.\n\nInfluenza immunization is recommended annually in the fall\nfor all infants once they reach 6 months of age.  Before this\nage, and for the first 24 months of the child's life,\nimmunization against influenza is recommended for household\ncontacts and out-of-home caregivers.\n\nFOLLOW UP APPOINTMENTS SCHEDULED OR RECOMMENDED:\n1.

No atrial septal defect is\nseen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses\nare normal. The left\nventricular cavity size is normal. There is severe global left\nventricular hypokinesis (ejection fraction 20-30 percent). There\nis no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size\nand free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)\nare mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace\naortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are\nmildly thickened.

DDX includes viral myocarditis,\nceliac disease, lupus, hypo/hyperthyroidism. Thyroid tests\nnormal at OSH. She did have symptoms of URI and gastroenteritis\nthat could be associated with a viral syndrome causing viral\nmyocarditis. She also had iron def anemia which is seen with\nceliac disease which can rarely cause a cardiomyopathy. TTG was\nsent off for this reason and was pending on discharge. She was\nplaced on a nitro gtt and continued on ACEI for afterload\nreduction.  She had a good response to lasix in the cath lab\nwith improvement in her PCWP.  She was then started on lasix\n20mg PO daily.  She was also continued on low dose BB, later\nswitched to Toprol XL.\n.\n2) ? hypertension- no reported history of HTN, however patient\ndid have LVH on echo  at OSH (not seen on TTE here, however\nevident on EKG).  Hypertension is a possible etiology of her\nnewly diagnosed cardiomyopathy.  She was continued on lisinopril\nas above and her lopressor was titrated up for BP control.\n.\n3) CAD: Had clean coronaries on cath making ischemic etiology of\nher CM very unlikely. She denied chest pain and did not have\nischemic changes on EKG. Given her cardiac risk factors of age,\nsmoking, ? HTN and hyperlipidemia she was continued on ASA 81 mg\nand started on statin.\n.\n4) Rhythm: Followed on tele with no significant arrythmias\nnoted.\n.\n5) Hyperlipidemia: Started statin after LFTs had been checked.\n.\n6) Elevated FS: Likely were from solumedrol she was receiving at\nOSH for presumed asthma flare. Unlikely that she had asthma\nflare, more likely her SOB was from her cardiomyopathy and\nelevated filling pressures.  Steroids were not continued on\narrival to [**Hospital1 18**] and her FS normalized.\n.\n7) Iron def anemia: Confirmed with iron studies, continued\nFeSO4. Patient will need a workup for anemia (colonoscopy) as an\noutpatient.\n.\n8) FEN: low salt diet\n.\n9) PPX: pneumoboots, PPI\n.\n10) Access: PIV\n.\n11) Code: full\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nHome medications:\nProtonix 40 mg daily\nMVI\nProzac\n.\nMedications on transfer:\nAspirin 325mg daily\nProzac 10mg daily\nLasix 20mg IV daily\nAspirin 325mg daily\nLopressor 12.5mg daily\nProtonix 40mg daily\nKCL 20meq daily\nMetamucil 1 packet\nAltace 2.5mg daily\nSolumdrol 60mg IV q 12 hours\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

There was no hemorrhage on CT.  An\nMRI/MRA did not show any vascular cutoff but there was an area\nof\nrestricted diffusion and tPA was administered just under the 3\nhour mark.  Since then she has had little change in her weakness\nor numbness.  She has had brief 30 second episodes of left\nfacial\ntwitching which resolved after being loaded on dilantin.\n\n\nPast Medical History:\n-h/o nephrectomy\n-h/o breast lumpectomy\n-hypertension\n\n\nSocial History:\n-lives by self and is independent in all ADLs\n-no recent alcohol or tobacco use\n\n\nFamily History:\n-no history of seizures or strokes\n\n\nPhysical Exam:\nGeneral:  elderly woman in no acute distress\nNeck: supple\nLungs: clear to auscultation\nCV: regular rate and rhythm\nAbdomen:  non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present\nExt: warm, no edema\n\nNeurologic Examination:\nMental Status:\nAwake and alert, cooperative with exam, normal affect\nOriented to person, place, month and president\nAttention: Can say months of year backward and forward\nLanguage: Fluent, mild dysarthria, no paraphasic errors, naming\nintact\nFund of knowledge normal\nNo apraxia, No neglect\n[**Location (un) **] intact\n\nCranial Nerves:\nVisual fields are full to confrontation.

Patient sustained some improvement in left arm\nstrength s/p tPA.  She had a follow up head CT which showed no\nevidence of hemorrhage s/p tPA.  While in the ICU, the patient\ndeveloped focal motor seizures (left facial twitching) and was\nloaded with dilantin. An EEG was ordered while the patient was\nin the ICU.  The EEG showed sharp waves and slowing in the right\nfrontotemporal/frontocentral areas and left temporal lobes\nsuggesting deep midline subcortical dysfunction consistent with\nencephalopathy.  The EEG is also consistent with abnormalities\nseconardary to a large stroke.  The patient's dilantin level was\nroutinely checked and was therapeutic on discharge.  She will be\ncontinued on daily dilantin.\n\nStroke etiology was evaluated with several tests. Carotid\nultrasound was performed which showed no significant hemodynamic\nlesions in either the right or left carotids.  Echocardiogram\nwas performed which showed an EF of 55% and no evidence of clot\nor thrombus.  The patient's LDL was 95 and she was started on\nlipitor 20 mg daily.  She also ruled out for a myocardial\ninfarction by three sets of cardiac markers.  The patient was\nalso started on an aspirin (325mg); on the day of discharge\naggrenox was added and her aspirin dose was decreased to 81 mg.\nThe patient is to continue with both medications for the next\ntwo weeks and then is to discontinue aspirin and continue on\naggrenox alone.  It is also recommended that the patient be\nstarted on an ACE-inhibitor.  Her beta blocker (metoprolol) was\nheld in the peristroke period.\n\nOver the course of her hospitalization, the patient's proximal\nleft arm strength appeared to improve, however she did not\nregain any movement in her left wrist, hand or fingers.  Her\nleft leg strength also improved.\n\nThe patient passed the swallow evaluation and she was started on\na full regular diet.  She was evaluated by physical therapy and\noccupational therapy and inpatient rehabilitation was deemed\nappropriate.  She is to be discharged to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with\nfollow up in the neurology stroke clinic.\n\nMedications on Admission:\n-metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 **]\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

[**Name (NI) **]\n[**Name2 (NI) 82999**] was able to be aroused, though was groggy.\n.\nAt OSH ([**Hospital3 **] Hospital), he underwent head CT and was found\nto have a small subarachnoid hemorrhage. Cervical and lumbar\nspine CT were also performed prior to transfer with no evidence\nof fracture. He was seen in cardiology consultation and had his\ndevice interrogated. It was hypothesized at that time that his\nFidelis RV lead had fractured, which was inhibiting V-pacing\nresulting in periods of asystole. The timing of these events\ncoincides with his syncopal episodes. Attempts to program RV\nsensing off were unsuccessful. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] have\nan extraction of the Fedelis lead and a new lead implantation.\nOf note, he was anticoagulated with warfarin for his atrial\nfibrillation and after INR was noted to be 2.6 at OSH, he was\ngiven Vitamin K 5 mg and then 2 units of FFP.\n.\nUpon arrival to the floor here the patient reports he had been\nhaving episodes of \"wooziness\" for approximately 2 weeks, noting\n\"hundreds\" of episodes where he has to sit down or slow his pace\nfor fear of passing out.

Compared to the previous tracing of\n[**2153-6-16**] no\nchange.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n83-yo man with HTN, Afib on coumadin, non-ischemic CMP, ?h/o\ntachy-brady versus complete heart block, s/p dual chamber\npacemaker in [**2143**] with upgrade to dual chamber BiV [**2149**], who\npresents with presyncope/syncope, falls, and SDH/SAH on NCHCT,\nfound to have a likely fractured RV lead resulting in episodes\nof syncope, now s/p temporary pacing wire placement in right IJ\nby EP and awaiting lead revision.\n.\n#. RHYTHM:  83-yo man with hypertension, atrial fibrillation,\nnon-ischemic cardiomyopathy, and ? h/o tachy-brady versus\ncomplete heart block, s/p dual chamber pacemaker placement in\n[**2143**] with upgrade to dual chamber BiV in [**2149**]. In recent weeks\nhe has been having frequent episodes of dizziness and feeling\nfaint, as well as three syncopal episodes in the last week, most\nrecently one day prior to admission when he fell and hit his\nhead and was unarousable for approx 2 minutes. At [**Hospital3 **]\nHospital, he underwent a NCHCT that revealed a small SAH.\nC-spine and L-spine CTs did not show any evidence of fracture.\nCardiology was consulted and his device was interrogated, and he\nwas found to be having episodes of asystole that were felt to\ncoincide with these events. It is hypothesized that his Fidelis\nRV lead is fractured which is inhibiting V-pacing and resulting\nin these episodes of asystole, and attempts to program RV\nsensing off were unsuccessful, so he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]\nfor extraction of the Fidelis lead and implantation of a new\nlead. He is anticoagulated with an INR of 2.6, so received 5mg\nPO Vitamin K and 2units FFP prior to transfer.\n.\nOn transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], he was continued on his home BB and\namiodarone, but he continued to have symptomatic pauses as long\nas 6-7 seconds overnight, with an episode of syncope that\ncorrelated with a pause on telemetry. He was seen by EP, who\nattempted to adjust his pacemaker settings, but he was\nultimately taken to the EP lab for placement of a temporary\npacing wire [**6-15**]. He was transferred to the CCU for continued\nmonitoring and remained stable. Pt remained stable over the\nweekend and did not become bradycardic or hypotensive. Pt went\nfor pacemaker revision on [**6-18**]. Pt did well and was transfered\nback to the floor. Pt did not develop any complications from the\nprocedure.\n\n.\n#. SDH/SAH: Post-traumatic in setting of syncope/fall while\ntherapeutic on coumadin with INR 2.8. At [**Hospital3 **] Hospital, he\nunderwent a NCHCT that revealed a small SAH. C-spine and L-spine\nCTs did not show any evidence of fracture.  At [**Hospital1 18**] he was also\nseen by Neurosurgery and underwent urgent NCHCT, which revealed\nbilateral subacute-chronic hemispheric SDH, acute post-traumatic\nSAH, a small subgaleal hematoma, and cavernous malformation\nversus parenchymal hemorrhagic contusion. This was not felt to\nbe significantly different from the serial NCHCTs he received at\nOSH prior to transfer. He was placed in a soft collar for\ncomfort and received an additional 2mg PO Vitamin K and 2units\nFFP for INR 1.8, with unremarkable neuro checks overnight.  He\nreceived a total of Vitamin K 7mg PO and 4units FFP w/ INR 1.4.\nNeurologically intact without concerning neuro checks and\nSDH/SAH stable per NSG. His C-spine was clinically cleared on\n[**6-16**].  Pt had repeat CT heads without signficant interval\nchange. Pt is to have a repeat CT head on [**6-21**] and follow up\nwith Neurosurgery with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 1 mo. Pt also received 3d\nof Vancomycin prior to procedure. Vancomycin was d/c'd on\n[**2153-6-19**] and switched to 7 day course of Levofloxacin.\n\n# PUMP: ECHO: EF 30-35% Moderate global left ventricular\nsystolic dysfunction. Severe tricupsid regurgitation, mostly\naround the multiple pacemaker/defibrillator leads.

lastname 67621**] was admitted to\nthe NICU at approximately 48 hours of age for evaluation and\ntreatment of significant hyperbilirubinemia. He was born\nweighing 3675 grams, a term gestation to a 20-year-old primip\nwhose pregnancy was complicated only by gestational\nhypertension. Labor was unremarkable. Infant delivered by SVD\nwith Apgars of 8 and 9.\n\nMother's prenatal screens are blood type O+, antibody\nnegative, RPR nonreactive, HBSAG was not available at the\ntime of admission (however, later it was determined that the\nmother was HBsAg negative). The infant had done well in the\nnormal nursery, was ad lib. breast feeding with no\nsupplementation.\n\nThe bilirubin was done at 36 hours of age which showed a\nbilirubin level of 20.8. A CBC and reticulocyte were sent.\nThe hematocrit was 43. The infant was ordered to start under\nphototherapy. 4 hours later a repeat bilirubin level was\nsent, and the bilirubin had gone up to 23.3/0.5. At that time\nthe infant was admitted to the NICU.  The baby's blood type\nis B+, but the DAT was also positive.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The birth weight is 3675,\n90th percentile; length is 52 cm, which is 90th percentile;\nhead circumference is 34 cm, which is 50th-75th percentile.\nOn exam the infant is jaundiced but active in term. Has HEENT\nthat is normal. Normal heart rate and rhythm. Normal S1, S2.\nNo murmurs. Lungs are clear and equal. Abdomen is benign. No\nhepatosplenomegaly. Normal male genitalia. Neurologic exam is\nnormal for term infant. Normal cry. Normal tone.\n\nSUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:\nRespiratory: The infant remained in room air since admission\nto the NICU and has had no issues with apnea. Has maintained\nnormal breathing rate and rhythm, with no increased work of\nbreathing.\n\nCardiovascular: The infant has maintained a normal\ncardiovascular status- has not presented with any murmurs,\nhas normal heart rate and rhythm, normal blood pressure, and\nis well perfused.\n\nFluids, electrolytes, nutrition: Due to the significant\nbilirubin increase on admission, the patient was briefly made\nNPO and started on IV fluids of D10 with electrolytes. He was\nalso given a single normal saline bolus due to question of\nsome dehydration from sole breast feeding. The infant was\nstarted on feedings approximately 6 hours after admission to\nthe NICU when the bilirubin level did start to drop. No\nelectrolytes have been measured. The most recent weight is\n3625 grams on [**2171-8-11**].\n\nGI: After initiating of phototherapy with quadruple\nphototherapy on admission to the NICU, the bilirubin level\nquickly started to drop down. Within 3 hours of initiation of\nphototherapy on admission to the NICU, bilirubin dropped to\n20. The next subsequent day it had continued to decrease.\nPhototherapy was slowly withdrawn with a bilirubin level of\n10.9/0.3 on [**2171-8-11**]. The phototherapy was completely\ndiscontinued, and a rebound bilirubin level was drawn 8 hours\nafter that. That bilirubin level was unchanged at 10.9/0.3.\nThe infant was discharged to home and returned to the NICU on\n[**8-12**] for a follow-up bilirubin.  The level was 11.3/0.4.\n\nHematology: As stated previously, the infant's blood type is\nB+. Coombs' positive. The hematocrit has stayed stable.\nThe hematocrit on admission was 43, and it was 42.3 on [**2171-8-10**]. The patient has remained pink and well perfused. A\nreticulocyte count was done on [**2171-8-10**], which was 10.8.\nInfant has required no blood product transfusion.\n\nInfectious disease: There have been no infectious disease\nissues at this time.\n\nNeurology: The infant has maintained a normal neurologic exam\nfor a term male infant.\n\nSensory/Audiology: A hearing screen was performed with\nautomated auditory brainstem responses, and infant passed in\nboth ears on [**2171-8-11**].\n\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Good.\n\nDISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  Home with the family.\n\nNAME OF PRIMARY PEDIATRICIAN:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 38832**], MD [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 8513**]\n[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], NNP [**Location 67622**]Pediatrics.

Axial\nimaging was performed with gradient echo technique in the\ncervical spine and\nlong TR, long TE fast spin echo technique in the thoracic and\nlumbar spines.\nComparison to T-spine CT studies of [**2191-6-12**].\n\nFINDINGS: There appears to be a fracture of the superior portion\nof the T1\nvertebral body, also involving the inferior C7 body. There is\nwedging of the\nT1 and discontinuity of the anterior margins of the vertebral\nbodies at this\nlocation. There is hyperintensity in the C6 vertebral body on\nthe STIR images\nwithout definite evidence of fracture. There is hyperintensity\nin the C6-C7\nand C7-T1 intervertebral discs, compatible with acute trauma.\nThere is faint\nhyperintensity on STIR images in the posterior ligamentous\ncomplex at C6,\ncompatible with the spinous process fracture seen on the CT.\nThere is\nextensive prevertebral fluid, presumably hemorrhage. There\nappears to be\nintraspinal hemorrhage posterior to the spinal cord at the level\nof the\nligamentous injury, with unclear extent within the spinal canal.\nAt a\nminimum, this appears to be present at the C5 through C7 levels,\nbut may\nextend farther inferiorly into the thoracic spinal canal.\n\nThe patient has classic imaging findings of ankylosing\nspondylitis and has\nundergone posterior fusion with rods and pedicle screws from\nT7-T12.\n\nImages of the lumbar spine demonstrate changes of ankylosing\nspondylitis with no evidence of fracture or abnormalities\nencroaching on the spinal canal.\n\nThere appears to be a defect in the T11 vertebral body. There is\nno evidence of encroachment on the spinal canal or spinal cord\nat this level and no evidence of hemorrhage.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n1. Unstable-appearing cervical spine fracture with disruption of\nthe C6-C7\nintervertebral level, the C7 inferior vertebral body, and the\nsuperior T1\nbody. Extensive prevertebral soft tissue fluid. Hyperintensity\nin the\nposterior ligamentous complex suggesting fracture. Intraspinal\nfluid\ncollection, presumably epidural hematoma, posterior to the\nspinal cord at this\nlevel.\n2. Hyperintensity and apparent fracture of the superior portion\nof the T11\nbody, without evidence of hemorrhage.\n3. Ankylosing spondylitis, status post lower thoracic spine\nfusion.\n\nECG\nBaseline artifact. Probable sinus rhythm. P-R interval\nprolongation.\nIntraventricular conduction delay of right bundle-branch block\ntype with marked left axis deviation. Consider left anterior\nfascicular block. Since the previous tracing of [**2191-6-12**]\ndifferences may be due to artifact. Otherwise, findings are\nunchanged.\n\n[**6-15**] CXR: Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in\ncomparison to [**2191-6-13**]. The patient's head obscures lung\napices . Heart size, mediastinal contours are unremarkable.\nThere is interval resolution of pulmonary edema.

lastname **], whose last\nname will be [**Name (NI) **] at discharge, was born at 33 and 2/7\nweeks gestation by Cesarean section for non reassuring fetal\nheart rate. Mother is a 33 year-old, Gravida IV, Para 1 now 2\nwoman.  Mother's prenatal screen included blood type A\npositive, antibody screen negative, Rubella immune, RPR non\nreactive, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, and group B\nstrep unknown. The previous pregnancies were remarkable for\nintrauterine fetal demise at 17 weeks in [**2158**] and a 28 week\ndelivery in [**2160**].  That child is alive and well. She also had\na spontaneous loss in [**2167**].  This pregnancy was complicated\nby:  (1) cervical incompetence, treated with cerclage at 14\nweeks and managed with progesterone in light of the previous\npregnancy history. (2) Increased nuchal lucency and a 2\nvessel umbilical cord. (3) Amniocentesis with a normal\nkaryotype of 46XX.  (4) Normal fetal echo x2 at [**Hospital3 18242**].  (5) Intrauterine growth restriction. The mother\nreceived a complete course of betamethasone at 30.5 weeks\ngestation.\n\nRupture of membranes occurred at time of delivery with yellow\nstained amniotic fluid. The infant received free flow oxygen\nand mask C-Pap in the delivery room. The Apgar scores were 6\nat 1 minute and 8 at 5 minutes.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, weight was 1235 grams,\nless than the 10th percentile.  Length 38 cm, less than the\n10th percentile.  Head circumference 25 cm, less than the\n10th percentile. This small for gestational age dysmorphic\ninfant with anterior fontanel and posterior fontanel both\nopen, soft and flat, no cutis aplasia, low nuchal hair line,\nthickened nuchal fold, hypertelorism with wide nasal bridge\nand beaking of the nose, cleft palate both hard and soft,\nintact lip. Ears slightly low set and posteriorly rotated\nwith somewhat central pinna.  Red reflexes present, positive\nbrush-field spots. Wide space nipples. Short sternum.  Fair\naeration. Crackly breath sounds. No murmur. Normal pulses.\nSoft abdomen, 2 vessel cord. No hepatosplenomegaly.  No\nmasses.  Preterm female genitalia with large clitoris, small\nvaginal opening and a vaginal tag. Patent anus.  No hip\nclicks. Closed cleft in sacral area with sharp edges of\ncoccyx palpable. Post axial polydactyly bilaterally. No\nsyndactyly. Active with good tone.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  Respiratory:  [**Known lastname 64481**] was intubated soon\nafter admission to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. She\nreceived 2 doses of Surfactant for respiratory distress\nsyndrome. She was extubated to room air on day of life 2. She\nwas intubated and ventilated again on [**2170-9-5**] for her PDA\nligation and then about 12 hours ventilated postoperative and\nthen was extubated to room air. She has otherwise remained in\nroom air throughout her hospitalization. Currently, her\nrespiratory rates range in the 40s to 60s. She does have mild\nincreased work of breathing, associated with feedings or when\nshe is tired.\n\nCardiovascular: [**Known lastname 64481**] has had several echocardiograms\nsince delivery. Her most recent echocardiogram was prior to\nher PDA ligation and this showed a secundum atrial septal\ndefect, patent ductus arteriosus, valvular pulmonary\nstenosis, left pulmonary artery stenosis and pulmonary\nhypertension. In light of her pulmonary hypertension, the\ndecision was made to ligate her patent ductus arteriosus as\nthat was contributing to her pulmonary hypertension. Her\nductus arteriosus was ligated on [**2170-9-5**].  At the time of\ndischarge, [**Known lastname 64481**]'s heart range in the 140s to 160s. She\ncontinues to have a loud murmur, with normal pulses and\nperfusion. A recent blood pressure was 88/56 with a mean of\n64.\n\nFluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  [**Known lastname 64481**] was initially\nmanaged on total parenteral nutrition via a PICC line in the\nleft arm. Enteral feedings were started on day of life 3 and\nadvanced to almost full volume when she had an onset of\nbloody stools and was made n.p.o.  She remained n.p.o. for 14\ndays for presumed necrotizing enterocolitis and feeds were\nrestarted again on day of life 25.  She was advanced to full\nfeedings without problem. She was n.p.o. again briefly for\nher PDA ligation. At the time of discharge, she is on 30\ncalorie per ounce formula as Neo Care concentrated to 27\ncalories per ounce with 3 calories per ounce of corn oil or\nbreast milk with Neo sure powder to equal 27 calories per\nounce with 3 calories per ounce of corn oil added, to equal a\ntotal of 30 calories per ounce. She is feeding on ad lib\ndemand with a premature Habermann feeder and is taking\nanywhere between 150 to 180 ml/kg per day with slow weight\ngain. Discharge weight is 1840 grams. Length 43 cm. Head\ncircumference 27.5 cm.\n\nGastrointestinal:  [**Known lastname 64481**] was treated with phototherapy for\nhyperbilirubinemia of prematurity. Her peak bilirubin on day\nof life 3 with a total of 6.7, direct of 0.3.  On day of life\n8, she presented with frankly bloody stools. Her abdominal x-\nray showed mildly dilated bowel loops and a nonspecific gas\npattern. There was no pneumatosis. She was treated with 14\ndays of bowel rest and antibiotics.  Since refeeding, she has\ndone well without bloody stools.\n\nHematology:  She has not received any blood products during\nher NICU stay. Her last hematocrit on [**2170-8-18**] was 30 with a\nreticulocyte count of 4.3%. She received supplemental iron.\n\nInfectious disease:  [**Known lastname 64481**] received 48 hours of Ampicillin\nand Gentamycin changed to Cefotaxime. On admission for rule\nout sepsis, and sepsis was ruled out. Again, on day of life\n9, she received 14 days of Ampicillin and Cefotaxime for a\npresumed necrotizing enterocolitis. When she is not on\nAmpicillin, she has been receiving Amoxicillin 20 mg/kg per\nday for renal prophylaxis due to hydronephrosis.\n\nOn day of life 37, she received a 5 day course of\nErythromycin ophthalmic ointment for bilateral\nconjunctivitis.\n\nUrine was sent x3 for CMV and all were negative.\n\nRenal:  A renal ultrasound on [**2170-7-24**] showed small peripheral\ncysts within both kidneys suggestive of dysplasia. No\nhydronephrosis and a normal bladder. A follow-up renal\nultrasound on [**8-6**] showed appropriate interval growth of both\nkidneys. They continued to be echogenic with peripheral\ncysts, suggestive of dysplasia. In addition, a right distal\nhydroureter persistently noted without a ureterocele within\nthe bladder and a normal bladder. A follow-up voiding\ncystourethrogram is recommended after discharge. She will be\nfollowed by the renal service at [**Hospital3 1810**].\n\nGenetics:  She was evaluated by the [**Hospital3 1810**]\ngenetic team. She does have a karyotype of 46XX. In\naddition, her chromosomes are remarkable for 4P deletion,\nconsistent with [**Doctor Last Name 79**]-Hirschorn's syndrome. Additionally, she\nhas trisomy on the 17q chromosome. This is consistent with a\nvery poor prognosis cognitively and developmentally. The\n[**Doctor Last Name **] initially declined any further genetic testing but\nhave decided to pursue this at the [**Hospital3 1810**]\ngenetic department after [**Known lastname 64481**]'s discharge.\n\nOrthopedics:  [**Known lastname 64481**] was evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5385**] of\n[**Hospital3 1810**] plastic surgery and he removed the 6th\nfinger on the ulnar side of both hands on [**2170-8-27**]. The left\nside was connected with a skin bridge and the right side was\nconnected with a skeletal piece. The areas are healing well.\nIn addition, she was noted, on x-ray to have a hemi-vertebra\nat T8.\n\nNeurology: Due to her prominent coccyx and dimple, a spinal\nultrasound was done on [**2170-7-24**] which showed spinal cord conus\ndoes end normally at L1.\n\nHead ultrasound on [**7-24**] showed resolving bilateral germinal\nmatrix hemorrhages. A follow-up head ultrasound on [**7-31**]\nshowed evolving bilateral germinal matrix hemorrhage.\nAdditionally, some mild bilateral ventriculomegaly.  On\n[**2170-8-16**], a repeat head ultrasound again showed evolving\ngerminal matrix hemorrhages and stable mild ventricular\ndilatation.\n\nAudiology:  Hearing screening was performed with automated\nauditory brain stem response. She passed in both ears.\n\nOphthalmology:  The eyes were examined most recently on\n[**2170-8-27**] revealing maturing retinal vessels. A follow-up exam\nis recommended in 9 months.\n\nPsychosocial:  [**Known lastname 64481**]'s last name after discharge will be\n[**Known lastname **] which is the father's last name. This is the first\nbaby for this couple. The mother has another child previously\nborn at 28 weeks who is doing well. The father has 2\ndaughters. The [**Name2 (NI) **] are very involved with [**Known lastname 64481**]'s care\nand have been with her frequently throughout her NICU stay.\n\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable. Infant now 52 days old, 41\nand 6/7 weeks corrected post menstrual age.\n\nDISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  Discharged home with her [**Known lastname **].\n\nNAME OF PRIMARY PEDIATRICIAN:  [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 4320**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 69763**], MD, [**Street Address(1) 69764**]in [**Location (un) 669**].

Feeds:  Ad lib feeding with the Habermann feeder, 30\n    calories per ounce feedings with either Neo sure\n    concentrated 27 calories with 3 calories per ounce of\n    corn oil or mother's expressed breast milk with Neo sure\n    powder added to make 27 calories per ounce with 3\n    calories per ounce of corn oil.\n2.  Amoxicillin 36 mg orally daily - for UTI prophylaxis\n3.  Ferrous sulfate (25 mg/ml) 0.2 ml daily.\n4.  Car seat screening was not done as the infant will be\n    discharged home in a car bed.\n5.  Newborn state screen has been done on several occasions.\n    All have been normal.\n6.  Immunizations:  She received her 2 month immunizations on\n    [**2170-9-19**]. She received Pediarix, Hib, pneumococcal 7-\n    valient conjugate vaccine. The Pediarix was the first\n    time she received her hepatitis B.\n7.  Immunizations recommended:  Synagis RSV prophylaxis\n    should be considered from [**Month (only) **] through [**Month (only) 958**] for\n    infants who meet any of the following criteria:\n    (1) Born with hemodynamically signficant congenital heart\ndisease.\n    (2) Born at less than 32 weeks; (3) Born between 32 weeks\n    and 35 weeks with two of the following:  Day care during\n    RSV season, a smoker in the household, neuromuscular\n    disease, airway abnormalities or school age siblings; (4)\n    chronic lung disease.\nBecause of her heart disease and evidence of chronic lund\ndisease, we strongly recommend that she receive Synagis.\n\nInfluenza immunization is recommended annually in the fall\nfor all infants once they reach 6 months of age.  Before this\nage, and for the first 24 months of the child's life,\nimmunization against influenza is recommended for household\ncontacts and out-of-home caregivers.\n\nFOLLOW UP APPOINTMENTS SCHEDULED OR RECOMMENDED:\n1.

DDX includes viral myocarditis,\nceliac disease, lupus, hypo/hyperthyroidism. Thyroid tests\nnormal at OSH. She did have symptoms of URI and gastroenteritis\nthat could be associated with a viral syndrome causing viral\nmyocarditis. She also had iron def anemia which is seen with\nceliac disease which can rarely cause a cardiomyopathy. TTG was\nsent off for this reason and was pending on discharge. She was\nplaced on a nitro gtt and continued on ACEI for afterload\nreduction.  She had a good response to lasix in the cath lab\nwith improvement in her PCWP.  She was then started on lasix\n20mg PO daily.  She was also continued on low dose BB, later\nswitched to Toprol XL.\n.\n2) ? hypertension- no reported history of HTN, however patient\ndid have LVH on echo  at OSH (not seen on TTE here, however\nevident on EKG).  Hypertension is a possible etiology of her\nnewly diagnosed cardiomyopathy.  She was continued on lisinopril\nas above and her lopressor was titrated up for BP control.\n.\n3) CAD: Had clean coronaries on cath making ischemic etiology of\nher CM very unlikely. She denied chest pain and did not have\nischemic changes on EKG. Given her cardiac risk factors of age,\nsmoking, ? HTN and hyperlipidemia she was continued on ASA 81 mg\nand started on statin.\n.\n4) Rhythm: Followed on tele with no significant arrythmias\nnoted.\n.\n5) Hyperlipidemia: Started statin after LFTs had been checked.\n.\n6) Elevated FS: Likely were from solumedrol she was receiving at\nOSH for presumed asthma flare. Unlikely that she had asthma\nflare, more likely her SOB was from her cardiomyopathy and\nelevated filling pressures.  Steroids were not continued on\narrival to [**Hospital1 18**] and her FS normalized.\n.\n7) Iron def anemia: Confirmed with iron studies, continued\nFeSO4. Patient will need a workup for anemia (colonoscopy) as an\noutpatient.\n.\n8) FEN: low salt diet\n.\n9) PPX: pneumoboots, PPI\n.\n10) Access: PIV\n.\n11) Code: full\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nHome medications:\nProtonix 40 mg daily\nMVI\nProzac\n.\nMedications on transfer:\nAspirin 325mg daily\nProzac 10mg daily\nLasix 20mg IV daily\nAspirin 325mg daily\nLopressor 12.5mg daily\nProtonix 40mg daily\nKCL 20meq daily\nMetamucil 1 packet\nAltace 2.5mg daily\nSolumdrol 60mg IV q 12 hours\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

The left atrium is moderately\ndilated. There is mild-to-moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =\n40 %). The right ventricular free wall thickness is normal. Right ventricular\nchamber size is normal. with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve\nleaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no\naortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The\nmitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.\nThere is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.\nModerate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is a small to moderate\nsized pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.\n\nCompared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2174-5-2**], left and right ventricular contractile function and cardiac output are\nmarkedly improved, and tricuspid regurgitation is markedly reduced. The right\nventricle is significantly less dilated.\n\n\n</td><td>patient test information indication chemotherapy infiltrative cardiomyopathy height in weight lb bsa m2 m2 bp mm hg hr bpm status inpatient date time at test portable tte complete doppler full doppler and color doppler contrast none technical quality adequate interpretation findings left atrium moderate la enlargement right atrium interatrial septum mildly dilated ra left ventricle moderate global lv hypokinesis no resting lvot gradient right ventricle normal rv free wall thickness normal rv chamber size normal rv systolic function aorta normal aortic diameter at the sinus level normal ascending aorta diameter aortic valve normal aortic valve leaflets no as no ar no ar mitral valve normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial mr no mvp normal mitral valve supporting structures no ms trivial mr tricuspid valve normal tricuspid valve leaflets normal tricuspid valve supporting structures no ts moderate tr pericardium small to moderate pericardial effusion no echocardiographic signs of tamponade conclusions patient is now on milrinone mcg kg min the left atrium is moderately dilated there is mild to moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis lvef the right ventricular free wall thickness is normal right ventricular chamber size is normal with normal free wall contractility the aortic valve leaflets appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation no aortic regurgitation is seen the mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation there is no mitral valve prolapse trivial mitral regurgitation is seen moderate tricuspid regurgitation is seen there is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion there are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade compared with the findings of the prior study images reviewed of left and right ventricular contractile function and cardiac output are markedly improved and tricuspid regurgitation is markedly reduced the right ventricle is significantly less dilated</td><td>1</td><td>train</td></tr><tr><td>100044</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1688184</td><td>PCA Note 0700-1900\nI have read and agree with the above note written by [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 971**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 970**].\n</td><td>pca note i have read and agree with the above note written by</td><td>1</td><td>train</td></tr><tr><td>100044</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1688240</td><td>NPN\n\n\n#2&9 At 21:30 infant awake to feed, attempted to bottle but\ndid poorly taking only 25cc with frequent HR drops to 70's &\n80's, becomed dusky but quickly resolved with feeding\nstopping.
